Description:
This backend allows Unix local users to authenticate and use ownCloud using pwauth project (https://code.google.com/p/pwauth/).

If your ownCloud instance is on your desktop/laptop computer or your personnal server, you can use directly the PAM/Unix authentication instead of creating new accounts into ownCloud.

Use directly your desktop/laptop credentials or your personnal server Unix account!
